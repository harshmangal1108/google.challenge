# foobar.withgoogle.com

After googling some information about java and python features I got link to participate in google challenges. Before that day I din't know anything about foo.bar :) 

And BTW I'm QA Automation Engineer and not a strictly developer so my solution may look not as good as it could be.

Added jUnit tests to help verify your code and gradle.build file to simple configuration in your IDE.


### **Information which may help:**
* Each level has N level tasks (e.g. Level 1 - 1 task, Level 2 - 2 tasks, etc.)  
* You have 72 hours to submit your Answer or request a new one
* You can request only 1 new task per Level if you didn't submit previous one (not sure) 
* After new task request your time will reset back to 72 hours
* You can submit task only all tests are passed 100%
* After submitted task you can have break - the time stops until new request 

# My Tasks:
