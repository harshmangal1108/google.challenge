# foobar.withgoogle.com

After googling some information about java and python features I got link to participate in google challenges. Before that day I din't know anything about foo.bar :) 

And BTW I'm QA Automation Engineer and not a strictly developer so my solution may look not as good as it could be.

Added jUnit tests to help verify your code and gradle.build file to simple configuration in your IDE.


### **Information which may help:**
* Each level has N level tasks (e.g. Level 1 - 1 task, Level 2 - 2 tasks, etc.)  
* You have 72 hours to submit your Answer or request a new one
* You can request only 1 new task per Level if you didn't submit previous one (not sure) 
* After new task request your time will reset back to 72 hours
* You can submit task only all tests are passed 100%
* After submitted task you can have break - the time stops until new request 

# My Tasks:

### Level 1, Task 1
_I really don't remember and I can't find my Answer code, but it was really easy ;)_
### Level 2, Task 1

#### Google foo.bar bug (challenge resets after submit)
[After 3th tasks from Level 2 part 2 foobar let me submit solution]

_I'm on Level 2, part 2: (Level 2, 50%)_

_After I submitted challenge (java) I got nothing - the time stops and status doesn't update. Logout/Clear cash - doesn't work, all looks like I need request the new challenge but I did it twice! And it doesn't work at all!_

_I posted bug though Feedback command from foo.bar but who knows where it goes._
_Who knows where I can find foo.bar bug tracker? To understand what is going on. Also I will appreciate any help and advice. Thanks!_
