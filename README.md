# foobar.withgoogle.com

After googling some information about java and python features I got link to participate in google challenges. Before that day I din't know anything about foo.bar :) 

And BTW I'm QA Automation Engineer and not a strictly developer so my solution may look not as good as it could be.

### **Information which may help:**
* Each level has N level tasks (e.g. Level 1 - 1 task, Level 2 - 2 tasks, etc.)  
* You have 72 hours to submit your Answer or request a new one
* You can request only 1 new task per Level if you didn't submit previous one (not sure) 
* After new task request your time will reset back to 72 hours
* You can submit task only all tests are passed 100%
* After submitted task you can have break - the time stops until new request 

# My Tasks:

### Level 1, Task 1
_I really don't remember and I can't find my Answer code, but it was really easy ;)_
### Level 2, Task 1

# Google foo.bar bug (challenge resets after submit)
_I'm on Level 2, part 2: (Level 2, 50%)_

_After I submitted challenge (java) I got nothing - the time stops and status doesn't update. Logout/Clear cash - doesn't work, all looks like I need request the new challenge but I did it twice! And it doesn't work at all!_

_I posted bug though Feedback command from foo.bar but who knows where it goes._
_Who knows where I can find foo.bar bug tracker? To understand what is going on. Also I will appreciate any help and advice. Thanks!_
